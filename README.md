# python-projects
The projects I've made in python over the years for fun

3D_Graphics             - implementations of 3D graphics made from scratch
Elective                - work and project done for a school elective
Handwriting_Recognition - classifies characters drawn by the mouse
Learn_To_Fly            - genetic algorithm where 2D "birds" learn how to fly
Noise_Generation        - heightmap/noise generation: alternative method to perlin noise
Pendulum                - physics simulation of a pendulum
Snowflake_Generator     - generates rendom snowflake visualisations
Solar_System            - (personal favourite!) physics simulation of celestial bodies
Stars                   - 3D visualisation of Earth's nearest stars, using real data
